# Urban Data Science Portfolio – Naieme Golzari Osguie

This repository contains selected coursework and project work completed during my MSc in Urban Data Science and Analytics at the University of Leeds. The work spans topics such as housing and employment, accessibility, flood risk, environmental vulnerability, and machine learning — all focused on using spatial and statistical analysis to inform urban challenges.

## Contents

### `Multivariate correlation.ipynb`
Explores multivariate relationships using a real-world environmental dataset. Applies OLS regression, visual diagnostics (e.g. Q-Q plots), and Pearson correlation to investigate potential predictors and model assumptions.

### `Highstreet2_L.ipynb`
Focuses on clustering and spatial analysis of high street locations using POI data. Includes network-based clustering with DBSCAN and HDBSCAN, as well as visualisation of service concentrations and accessibility patterns.

### `Housing_Workforce.ipynb`
A project investigating how local employment distribution (by industry) correlates with housing prices in Greater London. Combines statistical modelling (regression, correlation analysis) with geospatial mapping using MSOA-level data.

### `FloodRisk-Obstacles.ipynb`
Uses official spatial datasets to visualise and explore flood risk in urban environments. Includes mapping techniques with GeoPandas and Contextily, and overlays built-up areas with flood zones to assess exposure and barriers to development.

### `Heat_Vulnerability.ipynb`
Assesses vulnerability to heat exposure by integrating spatial indicators (e.g. housing type, green coverage, social factors). Applies thematic mapping, spatial classification, and residual analysis to explore inequalities and exposure risks across urban areas.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Geospatial analysis with Python (`GeoPandas`, `contextily`, `folium`)
- Statistical modelling (`statsmodels`, `scipy`)
- Machine learning and clustering (`scikit-learn`, `HDBSCAN`, `DBSCAN`)
- Data cleaning, transformation, and visualisation (`pandas`, `seaborn`, `matplotlib`)
- Working with open data (ONS, NOMIS, OpenStreetMap)
- Communicating insights through maps and charts

## Focus
All projects are grounded in real-world urban issues, with the goal of using data science to improve understanding and decision-making in areas like housing, access to services, environmental planning, and resilience.
